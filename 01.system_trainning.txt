Overview of the Automation Orientation of Team 7 at KTP
Table of Contents
I. Overview of the Automation Orientation
 1. Developing a Shared Python Library on GitHub
 2. Continuing the Deployment of Automation Applications – App Development Orientation
 3. Research & Development for the Future
II. Conclusion

Objective:
Create a well-structured, easy-to-use programming toolkit (code library) for all engineers.

Increase code reusability and reduce time spent rewriting code from scratch.

Ensure stability, easy maintenance, and continuous updates.

Implementation Plan:

Build a standardized structure for the library: organized by modules and functions.

Define standards for writing docstrings and usage examples so that anyone can read, understand, and reuse the code.

Provide simple installation instructions (e.g., via pip install or folder cloning).

Include commonly used functions: reading data from ETABS, assigning data to ETABS (Load, Combination, Load Set, etc.), processing input data, plotting charts, exporting files, etc.

Facilitate knowledge and code sharing among engineers.

1. Developing a Shared Python Library on GitHub
With the existing library, building an app will save a lot of time.

All engineers can use it collectively.

It also makes updates and corrections easier in case of any errors.

Key Features:

Reusability: All employees can reuse the source code whenever needed.

Easy to Install: Just one command to set it up.

Ready to Use:
 • Includes commonly used functions
 • Reduces repetitive coding time
 • Makes it easier to share knowledge and source code among engineers

Example: Creating a column element in ETABS becomes effortless with just one predefined command from the library.

Status: The library is already in use across existing applications and is continuously maintained and updated.

2. Continuing the Deployment of Automation Applications – App Development Orientation
Objective:
Aim to build a fully automated workflow:
→ Process inputs (Excel, PDF, etc.)
→ Calculations (using internal libraries, developing calculation apps, lookup tools to support engineering work)
→ Interact seamlessly with analysis models (e.g., CSI ETABS, SAP2000 via API)
→ Generate reports automatically (export Word, Excel, or PDF reports)

Ideas:
See details on the next page.

In Addition:
Deploy tools to support repetitive daily engineering tasks.
→ More ideas are needed for this section.

Benefits:

Shorten project execution time

Minimize human errors caused by manual operations

Increase consistency among engineers

Workflow Steps:

Standardizing Input Data

Performing Calculations

Integrating Data into the Model

Automatically Generating Reports

Apps Developed and In Progress
INTERACTION PMM
 - Demo: PMM Description.pptx + Video_PMM.mp4

BEAM AUTOMATION
 - Demo: 20250228_BeamAutomation.mp4

CSI AUTOMATION
 - Extract data from ETABS
 - Add/edit data directly from interface
 - Update ETABS model accordingly

CHECK CORENET-X
 - Blue color: beams not in ST Submission
 - Red color: value mismatch with Corenet-X file

PDF FILE NAME
 - Supports renaming all files as desired

3. Research & Development for the Future
Personalized AI for Engineering

Develop a dedicated AI assistant for the company

Capabilities:
 • Understand technical terminology
 • Learn from internal libraries, project documents, and company standards
 • Support on-the-job training for new engineers

AI Project – Team 7

An initial version has been developed

Still in early stages; further R&D is planned

Built on the same database as ChatGPT

Will be trained with internal company data

Try it here: https://team7-ai.streamlit.app

II. Conclusion
A Workflow to Ensure Consistency and Knowledge Continuity

Automate the entire process: Apply automation to all steps to ensure continuity and consistency.

Standardize UI and color scheme: Define a UI guideline (colors, fonts, layouts…) for easy reuse.

Unify naming conventions and code structure: Consistent rules for file/variable/function names and folder organization.

Comprehensive documentation for each project (App):
 • Workflow Flowchart
 • Source Code
 • User Interface Design
 • User Guide
Goal: Ensure successors can quickly understand and further develop the project if needed.

e.g. How to design transfer beam. 
AI ans: The transfer beam is not considered a critical structural element. In standard practice, engineers typically provide only nominal reinforcement for such elements. (e.g. 3H10 top and bot through out)
